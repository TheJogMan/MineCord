# MineCord
Minecraft in Discord, created for Discord Hack Week 2019

Developed in Eclipse using JavaCord https://github.com/Javacord/Javacord<br>
More of a proof of concept than a proper "Minecraft in Discord" but I suppose that's what you get when an amateur gets a week to do something they have never tried before.<br>
Provides a 2D world that is 256 tiles in height, and may as well be infinite in both horizontal directions. This world is navigated and manipulated through the use of chat commands, and is displayed to the player as a grid of emojis.<br>
Once the bot is in your server, you can use the command "MineCord Help" to get a list of all available commands, "Create MineCord World" and "Delete MineCord World" are the only commands that are case sensitive.
